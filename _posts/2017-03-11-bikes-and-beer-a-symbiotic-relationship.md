> Hey Drew
> Long time since we spoke.
> It was with great sadness that I read today about the death of John Surtees, and for whatever reason, it made me think of you and the fact that we've not spoken in, well, flipping ages. And what with one thing and another, well, last year just wasn't a good time to get together at any point. But, are you doing anything this year in the way of shows, rides, or just pottering around? Would be great to get the SAS back together again if we can manage it.
> I'm still riding the Spit. And still loving every moment of it. What a truly beautiful thing you created.
> Cheers
> Neil
