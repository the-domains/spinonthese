# You are not an off-the-shelf human!

So why are you still riding an off-the-shelf bike? You know, one that was designed and sized for Mr / Ms Average? Life's too short to ride rubbish bikes. Especially when you could be heading out for a spin on nothing less than bespoke, made just-for-you and no-one else, full custom.

I'm not talking bike shop "custom". Take a stock frame and let you choose the brake calipers and gears, maybe the stem and bar width kind of custom. Trying - mostly in vain - to fit you to a bike made for nobody in particular. 

No, I'm talking nothing less than a frame with every tube length precision cut and mitred to the millimetre. With every angle, every tube diameter and shape carefully considered and chosen to optimise the ride for you, and the way you ride. 

The feeling of riding a bike where your frame fits you like the proverbial glove will delight you - both mentally and physically. No more compromise or endless tweaking your bar height, hood tilt, saddle this way and that. Just perfect fit and effortless, confident, precise handling. 

No more _**speed wobble**_, or _**guessing**_ how much grip you'll have in that next corner. Why? Because with a frame engineered for you, your centre of gravity now resides as close to the perfect place as possible: low down and deep within the wheelbase, with enough of your weight pressing down both front and rear wheels for neutral, telepathic handling that you barely need to think about. 

That's what good frame design is all about -through sizing and geometry, optimising the dynamics of the rider. Your bike becomes the perfect connection between you and the road, the trail, or the boards. 

All of this sounds expensive. And I won't claim this will be the cheapest bike you can acquire. Only the best. 

In fact, with my custom titanium frames starting at **£1995**, you could go out and spend far more on a famous brand off-the-shelf bike - that will be out of date in 9 months when the replacement model is unveiled. 

And often, you'll have to wait quite a while to get your first ride on it, depending on when "your size" comes back into stock. 

On average, our custom frames go from drawing board to your first ride in 6-8 weeks.
