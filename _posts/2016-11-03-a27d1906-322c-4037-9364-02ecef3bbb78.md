Cycling Plus Magazine's Warren Rossitter stopped by my stand at the annual UK Cycle Show one year and this bike caught his eye. I built it up to use in a Guess The Weight competition to highlight most rider's mistaken belief that in order to be light, a bike frame must be made of carbon fibre these days.

So, naturally, most of the riders who entered the draw thought: hey look, a bike still made out of metal! It must weigh a ton!

So they mostly got it wrong. Very, very wrong. I think the winner in the wrong contest was out by 30kg or so! The average guess was probably in the 9-10kg bracket.

It actually weighed in around 6.2kg if I remember correctly. But it was some time ago, so it may have been even lighter. It might even say so in the spread above if you look carefully.

> 6.18kg
