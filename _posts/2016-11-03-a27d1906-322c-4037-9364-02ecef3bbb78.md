# Very Important Bike!

---

Cycling Plus Magazine first saw this bike at the annual UK NEC Cycle Show, where we use it in a Guess The Bike's Weight competition. Most people thought, hey look, a bike made out of metal, it must weigh a ton. So they got it wrong.

It actually weighed in around 6.5kg if I remember correctly. But it was some time ago, so it may have been even lighter. It might even say so in the spread above if you look carefully.
