# Very Important Bike!

---

Cycling Plus Magazine's Warren Rossitter stopped by my stand at the annual UK Cycle Show one year and this bike caught his eye. I built it up to use in a Guess The Weight competition to highlight most rider's mistake that to be light, a bike frame must be carbon fibre these days. 

So, naturally, most of the riders who entered the draw thought, hey look, a bike still made out of metal, it must weigh a ton! So they got it wrong.

I think the winner in the wrong contest was out by 30kg or so!

It actually weighed in around 6.2kg if I remember correctly. But it was some time ago, so it may have been even lighter. It might even say so in the spread above if you look carefully.
