# Look little fella, it'll be yours one day - but not just yet!

Every rider who takes their cycling seriously should consider custom. Get it right and it's the single best bike-flavoured investment you'll ever make.

And with Speed Metal titanium, the "good news" is, your bike will probably outlast you!

Still, you can always RIP in the certain knowledge that at least your loved ones will be riding on - in fast company and a certain amount of style!
