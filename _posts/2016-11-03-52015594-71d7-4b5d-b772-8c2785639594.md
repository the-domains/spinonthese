That's how Procycling Magazine Editor Jamie Wilkins kicked off his review of the Speed Metal Lightning X. His benchmarks for testing its road race performance were nothing less than the world's top carbon fibre bikes - you know, those one's ridden by the world's top pro cyclists who are the magazine's entire focus.

Just a few miles down the road, and a couple of lines into the review, he was smitten, declaring that this bike likes to be ridden FAST!
