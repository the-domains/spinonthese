# Simon Says ...why he chose \#custom and ended up with this special Lightning DX-1

### This bike is "the one!"

Ok, so a bit of background is warranted before I launch into how great this frame/bike is and why you should buy one from Spin Industries.   
I've been riding a Spin Spitfire Mk3 (M/L size frame) for a few years and it's been amazing so, when speaking to Drew @ Spin about upgrading to Di2 I decided to make the leap to a new frame - Lightning X1 custom - and build this up with Ultegra Di2, hydraulic disc brakes and Spin DMX440 carbon wheels.   
The build and quote process was smooth and informative, Drew answered numerous emails from me around sizing and accessories and provided very detailed plans of the frame ahead of sign off and production.   
This bike was a bit of a project for me so I bought the frame and parts from Spin and assembled the bike myself (an interesting process in itself) but the end result is fantastic.   
The frame is responsive, stiff but with enough flex to take out the harshness of UK roads and it handled the 100 mile London-Surrey sportive with ease and left me wanting to get back on it and ride home.   
I can't recommend Spin highly enough - if you choose, like me, to move away from a carbon framed bike and go Ti then you wont be disappointed.
