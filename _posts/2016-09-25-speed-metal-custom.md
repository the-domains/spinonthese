# Speed Metal Custom Lightning X-1

A custom fabricated Lightning X-1 is the beating heart and soul of what will become your ultimate road bike. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ae2ad448-8bcf-4863-9eb8-6d858016c84d.jpg)

This Lightning was finished with a Chris King Inset 7 headset in electric blue and the superstiff Fondriest TF2 carbon fork

All X-1's are engineered for optimal rider fit, laser-sharp precision handling, maximum all-terrain performance and ultimate all-day ride comfort. How is this magic combination possible in a single bike?

The answer lies most probably in the carefully chosen combination of aerospace grade materials and the precision engineering we employ to shape each tube on every frame we craft. And perhaps also, the fanatical attention to detail we bring to every stage of each frame's design and fabrication.

Take our hallmark chain-pip as a small but very good example of our craft. You can see it in the photo below, protruding from the drive-side seat stay just above the chain as it passes over the cassette.

Why is this tiny piece of meticulously machined 6-4 titanium beautifully welded onto every frame that has ever borne the Spin downtube marque? The answer is because, first and foremost, we are lifelong cyclists.

We ride what we make. And that which we make, we demand performs superbly! But I'm not only talking about the ride. I'm talking about ownership: the quality of living with your ride - day in, day out - and your experience of acquiring your ride.

When I look at a bike, one of the first things I ask myself is this. Is it made by someone who loves what they do, for the pure joy their craft can bring to others? Or is it made by a marketing company simply out to maximise profits? Or by someone who only makes bikes because it's the best job they can find at the moment?

To me, a maker who goes to the considerable extra trouble of adding this seemingly insignificant pip is saying a great deal about how he or she approaches bike making.

Simply put, the pip doesn't make your bike any easier for me to make. But it does make living with your bike easier. Ever need to pop your bike's rear wheel out for cleaning, routine service or simply to fit inside the boot of your car? No problem: slot your chain over the pip, and there's no longer any danger your chain will tangle or scratch the fancy paint job on your expensive carbon super bike.

But wait - how many carbon superbikes with fragile and fancy paint finishes have a chain pip? Well, I'm still looking! But the pip comes standard on all the frames we make, to ease your bike life, as we're bike riders too.

A pair of precision hand built Fast Fat Boy DM858 wheels make this X-1 Lightning one supremely fast and confident road machine!

Every rider lucky enough to have pushed the pedals on a Lightning, on even the shortest of test rides on either an original Mk X or the latest spec X-1, has come up against a problem: how to wipe the smile off their face!

Lightning is built fully custom to order, and can be specced for Di2, etap or mechanical shifting, disc or rim braking, internal or external routing, and always made to fit you millimetre perfectly.
