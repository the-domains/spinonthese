### Hey Drew, finally I got around to taking some photos of the Spitfire. It has been through many iterations and I think I have finally got where I want with it...

Hey Drew

I finally got around to taking some photos of the Spitfire. It has been through many iterations and I think I have finally got where I want with it.

Mainly Shimano Pro components with DA 9000m groupset. I really like Enve standard drop handlebars.....really liked them, as in best I have ever had, but wanted a matching cockpit. I do not like the idea of a carbon stem so went down the line of Pro, because it looks right with the Enve forks. If only Enve did an alloy stem. Now I love the Pro Seatpost and Stem, but am not 100% on the Pro Vibe Carbon bars........I know.......I have many problems in my head that are not necessarily translated into reality.

Still....I just cannot bring myself to sell the Enve bars!!!!

Otherwise

* Got rid of Chris King headset. Would never align properly. Massively over rated. I would not buy again. The £25 Spin headset is perfect.
* Still have Ti Stem & Seatpost - things may change in the future. I cannot bring myself to part with them because you never get fantastic money for Ti components on e-bay, so probably not worth selling
* Pretty happy with setup Geometry wise. About 9-10 cm drop. If I got a custom frame from you I would go for a slightly longer headtube. 3cm of steerer looks ok without being slammed. Most of all it is a comfortable position.

I have finally started getting some mileage on the bike. It is super comfy. Love the wheels. Wish I had gone for 58mm. I am not light and wind does not really bother me so 58 or 45 would have been fine. That said the 38s have become my every day all weather training wheel. I mean why not?
