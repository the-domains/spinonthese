## Very custom speed metal - Lightning X-1

Stock bikes off the shelf with uniform geometry are good, though as we all know we have to compromise on position, saddle for and aft, stem length etc...... but why when a few hours spent with Drew and his expertise will ultimately result in a frame that fit's you and you alone perfectly.

Having worked with Drew on this amazing bike I now have a true speed machine with stunning looks, superb handling and the most amazing fit all of which add up to a stunning super fast, accurate, comfortable and fatigue-less ride.

If you are reading this it means you're looking for that special bike. I can only encourage you to speak with Drew, be amazed by his skill knowledge and stunning customer service and get a bike that fits you perfectly.

Enjoy, I know I am and heads turn everywhere the bike goes....did I mention it really does go, it's not called speed metal for nothing!
